const calorieCounter = document.getElementById("calorie-counter");
// To access an HTML element with a given ID name, I use the getElementById() method. In the HTML, the ID for 
// the form is "calorie-counter", so that's what needs to be coppied into the parenthesis (as seen in orange).
// I stored this data in the calorieCounter variable.
